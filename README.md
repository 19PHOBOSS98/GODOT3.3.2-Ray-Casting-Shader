Though it may seem laggy when you play it in the editor, it really is buttery smooth after compiling it... on my Mac that is, I'm not so sure about other platforms cause the code is GPU related.

I couldn't use OBS in recording this cause I'm running on a ripe potato. It couldn't handle the overhead so I recorded it from inside the game using the _Godot Recorder addon:_

basically it takes pictures as I play and I use a video editor to stitch them up into a video. 

So the latest update is in branch "Portals&Planes". I'm not going to merge it with the main branch so people would see how the code progressed over iterations. Maybe even see a few of my mistakes and learn from it? idk.
